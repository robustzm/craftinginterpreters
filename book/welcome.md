^title Welcome

This could be the beginning of a grand adventure. Programming languages
encompass a huge space for you explore, play in, and perhaps carve out your own
territory where you build something new for others to use. Brilliant computer
scientists have spent entire careers traversing this land without ever reaching
the end. If this book is your first entry into the country, welcome.

The pages of this book give you a guided tour through a corner of the land of
languages. But before we strap on our hiking boots and venture out, we should
familiarize ourselves with the territory. The chapters in this part will
introduce you to the basic concepts programming languages use and how they are
organized.

We will also get acquainted with lox, the language we'll spend the rest of the
book implementing (twice). But, before that, we'll take a quick trip though
pancake, a little starter language so we can stretch our muscles and warm up for
the trip ahead.

Let's go!
