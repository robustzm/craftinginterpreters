Follow common usage to determine which acronyms and abbreviations are all caps
or not. "COBOL", "Fortran", etc.

The first time a technical term is introduced, make it bold. If it is quoted,
bold the quotes too. (This looks a little better, but also putting the bold
inside the quotes confuses smartypants.)

References to statements like "if statement" or "switch" are not code-formatted.
References to the *keywords* used by those statements are.

When referring to the Boolean values true and false, put them in code font, as
in "returns `true`". Use normal text when referring to truth or falsehood in
general.
