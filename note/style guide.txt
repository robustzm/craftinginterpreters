Follow common usage to determine which acronyms and abbreviations are all caps or not. "COBOL", "Fortran", etc.

The first time a technical term is introduced, make it bold. If it is quoted, bold the quotes too. (This looks a little better, but also putting the bold inside the quotes confuses smartypants.)
