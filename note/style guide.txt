Follow common usage to determine which acronyms and abbreviations are all caps
or not. "COBOL", "Fortran", etc.

The first time a technical term is introduced, make it bold. If it is quoted,
bold the quotes too. (This looks a little better, but also putting the bold
inside the quotes confuses smartypants.)

References to statements like "if statement" or "switch" are not code-formatted.
References to the *keywords* used by those statements are.

When referring to the Boolean values true and false, put them in code font, as
in "returns `true`". Use normal text when referring to truth or falsehood in
general.

Sentence? En dash? Colon?

Figuring out when to use "we" versus "it" when talking about the code is hard.
It's important to be clear because the prose talks about what the reader needs
to do "define this method", "replace this line", etc. and what the code needs
to do while it's running "match this token", etc.

But it gets really awkward to always use "it" for describing what the code does.
So the rough rules are:

1. When describing how the code must be changed, what the reader must
   mechanically do, use "we" (and not "you").
2. When describing how a piece of code works in general, use "it".
3. When walking through a hypothetical execution of the code, use "we".

I think those encapsulate how the existing chapters seem to naturally be
written?

If part of a word is emphasized, like *re*-define, hyphenate at the point where
the italics change.
