Following Scheme (R5RS):

- Assigning to an undefined name is a runtime error. It is not a compile time
  error.

  (define (setbar) (set! bar "wat"))  ; OK, though bar is undefined.
  (setbar)                            ; Runtime error.
  (define bar "ok")                   ; Now bar is defined.
  (setbar)                            ; Now it works.

- Top level variables can be defined multiple times.

  (define foo "1")
  foo               ; 1
  (define foo "2")  ; OK.
  foo               ; 2

- Accessing an undefined name is a runtime error. It is not a compile time
  error.

  (define (eval-foo) foo) ; OK, though foo is undefined.
  (eval-foo)              ; Runtime error.
  (define foo "ok")       ; Now foo is defined.
  (eval-foo)              ; Now it works.
