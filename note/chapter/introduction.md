Define "parameter" and "argument" early on.

--

Mention in intro that code is lightly documented because prose itself is docs.
Real code should have more docs.

--

When talking about compilers and interpreters, talk about what a "runtime" is
GC, object representation, etc. and where it lives. Many compiled languages
have no runtime. Others compile the runtime into the executable (Go, Haskell).
Interpreters host the runtime.

--

In intro, explain prereqs: expect them to be able to set up makefile or project
or whatever to build their code.

--

When defining "parameter", also mention "formal parameter".
