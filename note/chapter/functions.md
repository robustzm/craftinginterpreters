Question: Smalltalk implementations doesn't have to check that the number of
arguments to a method matches the number of parameters it expects. Why not?

--

In function chapter, have challenge to extend it with lambda expressions.

--

Define "parameter" and "argument" early on.

--

When defining "parameter", also mention "formal parameter".

--

Put check for too many arguments outside of parsing loop so that the parser
doesn't get into an ugly state if there are more than 8 arguments/params.
