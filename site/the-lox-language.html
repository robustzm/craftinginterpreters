</div>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to spend the rest of this book getting deeply acquainted with every dark and sundry corner of the Lox language. But it seems a little cruel to just drop you cold into implementing it from scratch without at least a taste of what we&rsquo;re cooking.</p>
<p>At the same time, I don&rsquo;t want to make you suffer through reams of language lawyering and specification before you get to touch your text <span name="home">editor</span>. So this will be a gentle, friendly introduction to Lox. It will leave out of a lot of details and edge cases. We&rsquo;ve got plenty of time for those later.</p>
<aside name="home">
<p>A tutorial isn&rsquo;t very fun if you can&rsquo;t try the code out yourself. Alas, you haven&rsquo;t implemented your Lox interpreter yet, so you don&rsquo;t have one. Fear not, if you&rsquo;d like, you can build it from <a href="https://github.com/munificent/crafting-interpreters">my repository</a>.</p>
</aside>
<h2><a href="#hello-lox" name="hello-lox"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;1</small> Hello, Lox</a></h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s your very first taste of <span name="salmon">Lox</span>:</p>
<aside name="salmon">
<p>The language, not the cured salmon. For all I know, you&rsquo;ve been eating the latter for ages.</p>
</aside>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// Your first Lox program!</span>
<span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>There&rsquo;s not much to this, but already a little bit of its nature is starting to
show. The <code>//</code> line comment, those parentheses after the function name, and
especially that trailing semicolon signal that Lox&rsquo;s syntax is a member of the C
family.</p>
<p>Now, I won&rsquo;t claim that <span name="c">C</span> has a <em>great</em> syntax. If we wanted something clean and simple, we&rsquo;d probably mimic Pascal or even Smalltalk. If we wanted to go full Scandinavian-furniture-minimalism, we&rsquo;d do a Scheme. All of those have their virtues.</p>
<aside name="c">
<p>I&rsquo;m surely biased, but I think Lox&rsquo;s syntax is pretty elegant. C&rsquo;s most egregious grammar problems are around types. Ritchie had this idea called &ldquo;<a href="http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/117024/why-was-the-c-syntax-for-arrays-pointers-and-functions-designed-this-way">declaration reflects use</a>&rdquo; where variable declarations look like the inverse of the operations to access a variable. It&rsquo;s an&hellip; <em>interesting</em>&hellip; concept, but I don&rsquo;t think it really worked out in practice.</p>
<p>We will avoid all of that nastiness in Lox.</p>
</aside>
<p>What C-like syntax has instead is something you&rsquo;ll find is often more valuable in a language: <em>familiarity</em>. Chances are, you already know how to read C-like syntax. In fact, you basically <em>have</em> to be comfortable with that style, because the two languages we&rsquo;ll be using to <em>implement</em> Lox, Java and C, also inherit it.</p>
<h2><a href="#a-high-level-language" name="a-high-level-language"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;2</small> A High-Level Language</a></h2>
<p>If <em>your</em> new language is going to carve out a corner of the world and be successful in it, odds are that it will be some kind of domain-specific or application scripting language. General purpose languages and lower-level &ldquo;system&rdquo; languages are way more work, and way harder to reach success with.</p>
<p>To that end, Lox is designed to be similar to those kinds of little &ldquo;glue&rdquo;
languages. The languages I think of along those lines are <span name="js">JavaScript</span>, Scheme, and Lua. Of those three, Lox looks most like JavaScript, mainly because most C-syntax languages do. As we&rsquo;ll learn later, Lox&rsquo;s approach to scoping hews closely to Scheme. The C flavor of Lox we&rsquo;ll build in Part III is heavily indebted to Lua&rsquo;s clean, efficient implementation.</p>
<aside name="js">
<p>Now that JavaScript has taken over the world and is being used to build all
sorts of ginormous applications, it&rsquo;s hard to think of it as a &ldquo;little scripting
language&rdquo;. But Brendan Eich hacked it into Netscape in ten days as a crude way
to make buttons animate on web pages. JavaScript has grown up since then, but it
used to be a cute little baby language.</p>
<p>A side effect of Eich slapping JS together with roughly the same raw materials
and time investment as an episode of MacGuyver is that it has some weird
semantic corners where the paper clips and duck tape show through. Things like
variable hoisting, dynamically-bound <code>this</code>, holes in arrays, and implicit
conversions.</p>
<p>Because I had the luxury of taking my time on Lox, it&rsquo;s a little more finely crafted.</p>
</aside>
<p>Lox shares another pair of features with those three languages:</p>
<h3><a href="#dynamic-typing" name="dynamic-typing"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;2&#8202;.&#8202;1</small> Dynamic typing</a></h3>
<p>A statically-typed language is effectively two languages in one. When writing code in a language like that, you have two rulesets to satisfy. You must think about what your code does at runtime, but also how it appears to the type checker. Correct code must please both of those masters simultaneously.</p>
<p>In large or performance-critical programs, the benefits of static analysis justify the added cognitive load. But for a hundred-line script that will never be run by anyone but its initial author, the value proposition isn&rsquo;t as clear.</p>
<p>So most scripting languages don&rsquo;t do any static checking. Variables can store values of any type, and a single variable can even store values of different types at different times. If you try to perform an operation on values of the wrong type&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;like trying to subtract a string from a number&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;then the error is detected and reported at runtime.</p>
<p>There are also pragmatic reasons for picking a dynamically typed language for this book. Type systems are a lot of work to learn and implement. Avoiding that&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;even if it means doing the type checking at runtime&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;leads to a simpler language and a shorter book. It will let us getting our interpreter up and executing bits of code sooner without having to build a type checker first.</p>
<h3><a href="#automatic-memory-management" name="automatic-memory-management"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;2&#8202;.&#8202;2</small> Automatic memory management</a></h3>
<p>High-level languages exist to eliminate error-prone low-level drudgery and what could be more tedious than manually managing the allocation and freeing of storage? No one rises and greets the morning sun with, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to figure out the correct place to call <code>free()</code> for every byte of memory I allocate today!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even most general-purpose languages today manage memory for you. That prevents two entire classes of common bugs&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;accessing uninitialized memory, and using memory after it&rsquo;s been freed. If the language prevents these, it offers <strong>memory safety</strong> and that&rsquo;s a huge deal when it comes to preventing security exploits and avoiding awful bugs where you accidentally misinterpret what some bits in memory represent.</p>
<p>There are two main <span name="gc">styles</span> of automatic memory management, <strong>reference counting</strong> and <strong>tracing garbage collection</strong> (usually just called &ldquo;<strong>garbage collection</strong>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>GC</strong>&rdquo;). Ref counters are much simpler to implement (I think that&rsquo;s why Perl, PHP, and Python all started out using them). But, over time, the limitations of ref counting&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;particularly around handling cycles of objects&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;become too troublesome, which is why all of those languages eventually ended up adding a full tracing GC or at least enough of one to handle cycles.</p>
<aside name="gc">
<p>In practice, ref counting are tracing are more ends of a continuum than a binary
choice. Most ref counting systems end up doing some tracing to handle cycles,
and you can think of the tracing step of a GC sort of like a lazily-calculated
reference count with only one bit of precision.</p>
</aside>
<p>Tracing garbage collection has a fearsome reputation. It <em>is</em> a little harrowing
working at the level of raw memory and debugging one can sometimes leave you
seeing hex dumps in your dreams. But, remember, this book is about dispell magic
and shining light on those bogeymen, so we <em>are</em> going to write our own garbage
collector. I think you&rsquo;ll find the <span name="debug">algorithm</span> is quite
simple and a lot of fun to write.</p>
<aside name="debug">
<p>In fairness, you probably won&rsquo;t find it much fun to <em>debug</em>. But you&rsquo;ll get to practice reading hex dumps! That counts for something, right? Right?</p>
</aside>
<h2><a href="#data-types" name="data-types"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;3</small> Data Types</a></h2>
<p>The atoms that make up matter in Lox&rsquo;s little universe are the built-in data types. There are only a handful. To create one in code, you use a <strong>literal</strong> — a tiny expression that evaluates to a new object of some primitive type.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><span name="bool">Booleans</span> –</strong> You can&rsquo;t code without logic and you
    can&rsquo;t logic without Boolean values. &ldquo;True&rdquo; and &ldquo;false&rdquo;, the yin and yang of
    software. Unlike some ancient languages that repurpose an existing type to
    represent truth and falsehood, Lox has a dedicated Boolean type. We may
    be traveling light on this expedition, but we aren&rsquo;t <em>savages</em>.</p>
<aside markdown="1" name="bool">

<p>Boolean variables are the only data type in Lox named after a person, George
Boole, which is why &ldquo;Boolean&rdquo; is capitalized. He died in 1864, nearly a
century before digital computers turned his algebra into electricity, and
131 years before countless Java programmers graffitied his name all over
their code.</p>
</aside>

<p>There are two Boolean values, obviously, and a literal for each one:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">true</span><span class="p">;</span>  <span class="c1">// Not false.</span>
<span class="nb">false</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// Not *not* false.</span>
</pre></div>


</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Numbers –</strong> Lox only has one kind of number: double-precision floating
    point. Since floating point numbers can also represent a wide range of
    integers, that covers a lot of territory, while keeping things simple.</p>
<p>Full-featured languages have lots of syntax for numbers&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;hexidecimal, scientific notation, octal, all sorts of fun stuff. For our minimal language we&rsquo;ll settle for only integer and decimal literals:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="mi">1234</span><span class="p">;</span>  <span class="c1">// An integer.</span>
<span class="mf">12.34</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// A decimal number.</span>
</pre></div>


</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strings –</strong> We&rsquo;ve already seen one string literal in the first example.
    Like most languages, they are enclosed in double quotes:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="s">&quot;I am a string&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>    <span class="c1">// The empty string.</span>
<span class="s">&quot;123&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// This is a string, not a number.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As we&rsquo;ll see when we get to implementing them, there is quite a lot of
complexity hiding behind that innocuous sequence of <span
name="char">characters</span>. To try to make our task marginally simpler, I
did remove one bit of extra work&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;escape sequences. Lox doesn&rsquo;t support
any:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="s">&quot;Not \n a newline.&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// Contains a backslash and &quot;n&quot;.</span>
</pre></div>


<aside markdown="1" name="char">

<p>Even that word &ldquo;character&rdquo; is a trickster. Is it ASCII? Unicode? A
code point, or a &ldquo;grapheme cluster&rdquo;? How are characters encoded? Is each
character a fixed size, or can they vary?</p>
</aside>

<p>This means there&rsquo;s no way to create a string containing a double quote.
I had to make some cuts <em>somewhere</em> to fit this language in a few thousand
lines of code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nil –</strong> There&rsquo;s one last built-in value who&rsquo;s never invited to the party
    but always seems to show up. It represents &ldquo;no value&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;null&rdquo; in
    many other languages. In Lox we spell it <code>nil</code>. (When we get to implementing
    it, that will make it easier in our code to tell when we&rsquo;re talking about
    Lox&rsquo;s <code>nil</code> versus Java or C&rsquo;s <code>null</code>.)</p>
<p>There are good arguments for not having a nil value in a language, since
errors where nil infects undesired parts of a programmer&rsquo;s code are endemic.
If we were doing a statically-typed language, it might be worth trying to
ban it. In a dynamically-typed language, though, it&rsquo;s virtually inevitable.
Nil creeps in in a couple of places:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s the value you get when you capture the result of a &ldquo;void&rdquo; function
    that doesn&rsquo;t return a value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s the value a variable has if you don&rsquo;t explicitly initialize it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we can&rsquo;t easily avoid those situations at compile time, and making
them an error is too annoying for users, we&rsquo;ll stuff <code>nil</code> in to fill in
those holes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#expressions" name="expressions"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;4</small> Expressions</a></h2>
<p>Now we can step up a level and start composing larger <strong>expressions</strong>.</p>
<h3><a href="#arithmetic" name="arithmetic"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;4&#8202;.&#8202;1</small> Arithmetic</a></h3>
<p>Lox features the basic arithmetic operators you know and love from C and other languages:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">add</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">me</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">subtract</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">me</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">multiply</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">me</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">divide</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="n">me</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Each of those has two <strong>operands</strong> and one goes on either side of the operator:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">left</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">right</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Because these operators take <em>two</em> operands, they are called <strong>binary</strong>
operators&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;it has nothing to do with the ones-and-zeroes use of &ldquo;binary&rdquo;.
Because the operator is <span name="fixity">fixed</span> <em>in</em> the middle of the
operands, these are also called <strong><em>in</em>fix</strong> operators as opposed to <strong><em>pre</em>fix</strong>
operators where the operator comes before and <strong><em>post</em>fix</strong> where it goes after
the operand.</p>
<aside name="fixity">
<p>There are some operators that have more than two operands and where the operators are interleaved between them. The only one in wide usage is the &ldquo;conditional&rdquo; or &ldquo;ternary&rdquo; operator of C and friends:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">condition</span> <span class="o">?</span> <span class="nl">then</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">otherwise</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Some call these <strong>mixfix</strong> operators. A few languages let you define your own operators and control how it is positioned&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;its &ldquo;fixity&rdquo;.</p>
</aside>
<p>One arithmetic operator is actually <em>both</em> an infix and a prefix one. Can you guess it? Right:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">negateMe</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>-</code> operator can also be used to negate a number.</p>
<p>All of these operators work on numbers, and it&rsquo;s an error to pass any other types to them. The exception is <code>+</code> and strings. If either operand of <code>+</code> is a string, then the other operand is converted to a string (if it isn&rsquo;t already one) and the results are concatenated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a proponent of implicit conversions in general, but this one saves us from needing to define explicit functions to stringify all the built-in types. We don&rsquo;t want to spend our time cranking out boring standard library functions.</p>
<h3><a href="#comparison-and-equality" name="comparison-and-equality"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;4&#8202;.&#8202;2</small> Comparison and equality</a></h3>
<p>Moving along, we reach the logical operators&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;the ones whose result is a Boolean. We can compare numbers (and only numbers), using Ye Olde Comparison Operators:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">less</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">than</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">lessThan</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">orEqual</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">greater</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">than</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">greaterThan</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="n">orEqual</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We can test two values of any kind for equality or inequality:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>         <span class="c1">// True.</span>
<span class="s">&quot;cat&quot;</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="s">&quot;dog&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// True.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Even different types:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="mi">314</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&quot;pi&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// False.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Values of different types are <em>never</em> equivalent:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="mi">123</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&quot;123&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// False.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Like I said, I&rsquo;m generally against implicit conversions.</p>
<h3><a href="#truth" name="truth"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;4&#8202;.&#8202;3</small> Truth</a></h3>
<p>Before we can get to the last pair operators in Lox&rsquo;s arsenal, we need to make a little side trip to go over one of the great questions of Western philosophy: <em>what is truth?</em></p>
<p>OK, maybe we&rsquo;re not going to really get into the universal question, but at least inside the world of Lox, we need to decide what happens when you use something other than <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> in a place where a Boolean is expected, like the condition in an <code>if</code> statement.</p>
<p>We <em>could</em> just say it&rsquo;s an error because we don&rsquo;t roll with implicit
conversions, but most dynamically typed languages don&rsquo;t. Instead, they take the
universe of values of all types and partition them into two sets, one of which
they define to be &ldquo;true&rdquo;, or &ldquo;truthful&rdquo;, or (my favorite) &ldquo;truthy&rdquo;, and the rest
which are &ldquo;false&rdquo; or &ldquo;falsey&rdquo;. This partitioning is fairly arbitrary and gets

<p>In JavaScript, strings are truthy, but empty strings are not. Arrays are truthy but empty arrays are&hellip; also truthy. The number <code>0</code> is falsey, but the <em>string</em> <code>"0"</code> is truthy.</p>
<p>In <em>Python</em>, empty strings are falsey as are all other empty sequences.</p>
</aside>
<p>Lox follows Ruby&rsquo;s simple rule: <code>false</code> and <code>nil</code> are falsey and everything else
is truthy.</p>
<h3><a href="#logical-operators" name="logical-operators"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;4&#8202;.&#8202;4</small> Logical operators</a></h3>
<p>Now where were we? Oh, right. Our last two operators are really control flow
constructs in the guise of expressions. An <span name="and"><code>and</code></span>
expression determines if two values are both truthy. It returns the left operand if it&rsquo;s falsey, or the right operand otherwise:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">true</span> <span class="k">and</span> <span class="nb">nil</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// &quot;nil&quot;.</span>
<span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="k">and</span> <span class="s">&quot;yes&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>  <span class="c1">// &quot;yes&quot;.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And an <code>or</code> expression determines if <em>either</em> of two values (or both) are
truthy. It returns the left operand if it is <em>truthy</em> and the right operand otherwise:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">nil</span> <span class="k">or</span> <span class="nb">false</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// &quot;false&quot;.</span>
<span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;aye&quot;</span> <span class="k">or</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span>   <span class="c1">// &quot;aye&quot;.</span>
</pre></div>


<aside name="and">
<p>I used <code>and</code> an <code>or</code> for these instead of <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> because Lox doesn&rsquo;t use
<code>&amp;</code> and <code>|</code> for bitwise operators. It felt weird to introduce the
double-character forms without the single-character ones.</p>
<p>I also kind of like using words for these since they are really control flow
structures and not simple operators.</p>
</aside>
<p>The reason <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> are like control flow structures, of course, is
because they <strong>short-circuit</strong>. Not only does <code>and</code> return the left operand if it is falsey, it doesn&rsquo;t even <em>evaluate</em> the right one in that case. Conversely, (&ldquo;contrapositively&rdquo;?) if the left operand of an <code>or</code> is
truthy, the right is skipped.</p>
<h3><a href="#precedence-and-grouping" name="precedence-and-grouping"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;4&#8202;.&#8202;5</small> Precedence and grouping</a></h3>
<p>All of these operators have the same precedence and associativity that you&rsquo;d
expect coming from C. (When we get to parsing, we&rsquo;ll get <em>way</em> more precise
about that.) In cases where the precedence isn&rsquo;t what you want, you can use <code>()</code>
to group stuff:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">average</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">min</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">max</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Since they aren&rsquo;t very technically interesting, I&rsquo;ve cut the remainder of the
typical operator menagerie out of our little language. No bitwise, shift,
modulo, or conditional operators. I&rsquo;m not grading you, but you will get bonus points in my heart if you augment your own implementation of Lox with them.</p>
<h2><a href="#statements" name="statements"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;5</small> Statements</a></h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve covered all the expression forms, so let&rsquo;s move up a level. Now we&rsquo;re at statements. Where an expression&rsquo;s main job is to produce a <em>value</em>, a statement&rsquo;s job is to produce an <em>effect</em>. Since, by definition, statements don&rsquo;t evaluate to a value, to be useful, they have to otherwise change the world in same way&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;usually modifying some state, reading input, or producing output.</p>
<p>Since Lox is a scripting language, the top level of a file of Lox code is just a list of statements. Unlike C and Java, the top level isn&rsquo;t pure declarations. Declarations are just another kind of statement.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve actually seen a bunch of statements already. Each line of code above is an expression followed by a <code>;</code>. This is called (imaginatively enough), an <strong>expression statement</strong>. The semicolon promotes an expression to statement-hood.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="s">&quot;A bare expression&quot;</span>
<span class="s">&quot;An expression *statement*&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// &lt;-- Statement-ize!</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you want to pack a series of statements where a single one is expected, you can wrap them up in a <strong>block</strong>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;One statement&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Two statements.&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Blocks also affect scoping, which leads us to the next section&hellip;</p>
<h2><a href="#variables" name="variables"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;6</small> Variables</a></h2>
<p>You declare variables using <code>var</code> statements. Like I mentioned before, you can omit the initializer to implicitly initialize the variable with <code>nil</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">imAVariable</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;here is my value&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">iAmNil</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Once declared, you can, naturally, access a variable by its name:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">breakfast</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;bagels&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">breakfast</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// &quot;bagels&quot;.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The interesting question is <em>where</em> in the program you can access some variable. This is called <strong>scoping</strong>, and we&rsquo;ll spend a surprising amount of time in later chapters mapping every square inch of the rules. For now, we&rsquo;ll just sketch them out.</p>
<p>A variable declared at the top level&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;not inside any block&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;is <em>global</em>. Global variables are a little more loosely bound than local variables for reasons we&rsquo;ll get into more later. Accessing a global variable before it is defined is a runtime error:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">later</span><span class="p">);</span>  <span class="c1">// Error!</span>
<span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">later</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;now I have a value&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Variables declared inside blocks are <em>local</em>. A local variable comes into being at the point that it is declared and goes out of scope at the end of the block containing it:</p>
<p><span name="breakfast"></span></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">breakfast</span><span class="p">);</span>         <span class="c1">// Error!</span>
  <span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">breakfast</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;bagel&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">breakfast</span><span class="p">);</span>         <span class="c1">// OK.</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">breakfast</span><span class="p">);</span>           <span class="c1">// Error!</span>
</pre></div>


<aside name="breakfast">
<p>Can you tell that I tend to work on this book in the morning before I&rsquo;ve had anything to eat?</p>

<p>It is an error to define two local variables with the same name in the same scope. It is <em>not</em> an error to define a local variable with the same name as a variable in an <em>outer</em> scope. This is called <strong>shadowing</strong>. The innermost variable obscures the outer one:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">scope</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;outer&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">scope</span><span class="p">);</span>         <span class="c1">// &quot;outer&quot;.</span>
  <span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">scope</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;inner&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">scope</span><span class="p">);</span>         <span class="c1">// &quot;inner&quot;.</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">scope</span><span class="p">);</span>           <span class="c1">// &quot;outer&quot;.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You can assign a new value to an existing variable using an assignment expression:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">breakfast</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;bagel&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">breakfast</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;bacon and eggs&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">breakfast</span><span class="p">);</span>              <span class="c1">// &quot;bacon and eggs&quot;.</span>
</pre></div>


<h2><a href="#control-flow" name="control-flow"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;7</small> Control Flow</a></h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to write <span name="flow">useful</span> programs if you can&rsquo;t choose to not execute some code, or execute something more than once. We need some more control flow structures. In addition to the logical operators we already covered, Lox inherits three of the control flow statements in a C-inspired syntax.</p>
<aside name="flow">
<p>We already have <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> for branching, and we could use recursion to repeat code, so that&rsquo;s theoretically sufficient. It would be a little strange to program that way in an imperative-styled language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting, though, that Scheme has no built-in looping constructs. It does rely on recursion for repetition.</p>
</aside>
<p>An <code>if ()</code> statement executes one of two statements based on some condition:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;something&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;yes&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;no&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Just like in the logical operators, we use truthiness to determine when a condition evaluates the then or the else branch. In this case, strings are truthy, so &ldquo;something&rdquo; is true and &ldquo;yes&rdquo; is printed.</p>
<p>You can omit the <code>else</code> clause if you want:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;something&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;yes&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I&rsquo;m using blocks in these examples, but almost statement is allowed:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;something&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;yes&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;no&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here we just use two expression statements directly. I say &ldquo;almost&rdquo; because we <em>do</em> prohibit statements that bind new names. That includes <code>var</code> statements as well as functions and classes, which we&rsquo;ll get to in a minute. Those can only appear at the top level or directly inside a block.</p>
<p>It avoids confusing code like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">condition</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;value&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">// Uh, is name in scope here?</span>
</pre></div>


<p>A <code>while</code> loop executes the body repeatedly as long as the condition expression evaluates to true:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Lox doesn&rsquo;t have <code>do-while</code> loops because they aren&rsquo;t that common and aren&rsquo;t any more technically interesting to implement than <code>while</code>. Go ahead and add it to your implementation if it makes you happy. It&rsquo;s your party.</p>
<p>Lox does have <code>for</code> loops:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This loop does the same thing as the previous <code>while</code> loop. Most modern languages also have some sort of <span name="foreach"><code>for-in</code></span> or <code>foreach</code> loop for explicitly iterating over various sequence types. In a real language, those are much better than the crude C-style <code>for</code> loop we got here. Lox, though, keeps it basic.</p>
<aside name="foreach">
<p>This is one of the concessions I made in Lox because the book splits the
implementation into separate chapters. A <code>for-in</code> loop needs some sort of
abstraction mechanism to polymorphically iterate over different kinds of
sequences, but we don&rsquo;t get into dynamic dispatch until after we implement
control flow.</p>
<p>We could circle back and add it later, but I don&rsquo;t think doing so
would teach you anything particularly interesting.</p>
</aside>
<h2><a href="#functions" name="functions"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;8</small> Functions</a></h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ve already seen a function call already with our friend <code>print</code>. Like most languages, a series of comma-separated arguments surrounded by parentheses a function call:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">makeBreakfast</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bacon</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">eggs</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">toast</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You can also call a function without passing any arguments to it:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">makeBreakfast</span><span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Unlike, say, Ruby, the parentheses are mandatory in this case. If you leave them off, it doesn&rsquo;t <em>call</em> the function, it just refers to it.</p>
<p>A language isn&rsquo;t very fun if you can&rsquo;t define your own functions. In Lox, you do that with <code>fun</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">fun</span> <span class="n">printSum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>After <code>fun</code>, you have the function&rsquo;s name and its list of parameters.</p>
<p>Now&rsquo;s a good time to clarify some terminology. Some people throw around &ldquo;parameter&rdquo; and &ldquo;argument&rdquo; like they are interchangeable and, to many, they are. We&rsquo;re going to spend a lot of time with splitting the finest of downy hairs around semantics, so it&rsquo;s handy for us to make our words a little more precise. From here on our:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An <strong>argument</strong> is an actual value you pass to a function when you call it.
  So a function <em>call</em> has an <em>argument</em> list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>parameter</strong> (called <strong>&ldquo;formal parameter&rdquo;</strong> or just <strong>&ldquo;formal&rdquo;</strong> by some)
  is a variable that holds the value of the argument inside the body of the
  function. Thus, a function <em>declaration</em> has a <em>parameter</em> list.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The body is always a block. Inside, you can return a value using a <code>return</code> statement:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">fun</span> <span class="n">returnSum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If a execution reaches the end of the block without hitting a <code>return</code>, it implicitly returns <code>nil</code>. See, I told you it would be hard to escape <code>nil</code>!</p>
<h3><a href="#closures" name="closures"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;8&#8202;.&#8202;1</small> Closures</a></h3>
<p>Functions are <em>first-class</em> in Lox, which just means they are real values that you can get a reference to, store in variables, pass around, etc. This works:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">fun</span> <span class="n">addPair</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">fun</span> <span class="n">identity</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">identity</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">addPair</span><span class="p">)(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">));</span> <span class="c1">// Prints &quot;3&quot;.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Since function declarations are statements, you can declare local functions inside another function:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">fun</span> <span class="n">outerFunction</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">fun</span> <span class="n">localFunction</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;I&#39;m local!&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="n">localFunction</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you combine local functions, first class functions, and block scope, you run into this interesting situation:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">fun</span> <span class="n">returnFunction</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">outside</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;outside&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>

  <span class="k">fun</span> <span class="n">inner</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">outside</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">inner</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">fn</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">returnFunction</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="n">fn</span><span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here, <code>inner()</code> accesses a local variable declared outside of its body in the surrounding function. Is this kosher? Since by now almost every language worth using has borrowed this idea from the Lisp folks, you probably know the answer is yes.</p>
<p>For that to work, <code>inner()</code> has to &ldquo;hold on&rdquo; to references to any surrounding variables that it uses so that they stay around even after the outer function has returned. We call functions that do this <span name="closure">&ldquo;<strong>closures</strong>&ldquo;</span>. These days, the term is often used for <em>any</em> first-class function, though it&rsquo;s sort of a misnomer if the function doesn&rsquo;t happen to close over any variables.</p>
<aside name="closure">
<p>Peter J. Landin coined the term. (Yeah, he coined damn near half the terms in
programming languages. Most of them came out of one incredible paper, &ldquo;The next
700 programming languages&rdquo;.)</p>
<p>In order to implement these kind of functions, you need to create a data
structure that bundles together the function&rsquo;s code, and the surrounding
variables it needs. He called this a &ldquo;closure&rdquo; because it &ldquo;closes over&rdquo; and
holds onto the variables it needs.</p>
</aside>
<p>As you can imagine, implementing these adds some complexity because we can no longer assume variable scope works strictly like a stack where local variables evaporate the moment the function returns. We&rsquo;re going to have a fun time learning how to make these work and do so efficiently.</p>
<h2><a href="#classes" name="classes"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;9</small> Classes</a></h2>
<p>Since Lox has dynamic typing, scope, and closures, it&rsquo;s about halfway to being a functional language. But it&rsquo;s <em>also</em> about halfway to being an object-oriented language. Both paradigms have a lot going for them, so I thought it was worth covering some of each.</p>
<p>There are two interesting questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Why should a programming language be object-oriented <em>in general?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is the language we&rsquo;re building <em>in this book</em> object-oriented?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><a href="#why-in-general" name="why-in-general"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;9&#8202;.&#8202;1</small> Why in general?</a></h3>
<p>It feels a little silly to have to justify the first question, but there&rsquo;s a backlash against object-oriented programming these days. Now that object-oriented languages like Java have sold out and only play arena shows, it&rsquo;s not cool to like them anymore.</p>
<p>It is true that the &ldquo;all inheritance all the time&rdquo; binge of the 90s produced some monstrous class hierarchies, but object-oriented programming is still pretty rad. Billions of lines of successful code has been written in OOP languages, shipping millions of apps to happy users. Likely a majority of working programmers today are using an object-oriented language. They can&rsquo;t all be <em>that</em> wrong.</p>
<p>In particular, for a dynamically-typed language, objects are pretty handy. We need <em>some</em> way of defining compound data types to bundle blobs of stuff together.</p>
<p>If we can also hang methods off of those, then we avoid the need to prefix all of our functions with the name of the data type they operate on to avoid colliding with similar functions for different types. In, say, Racket, you end up having to name your functions like <code>hash-copy</code> and <code>vector-copy</code> so they don&rsquo;t step on each other. Methods are scoped to the <em>object</em>, so that problem goes away.</p>
<h3><a href="#why-for-this-book" name="why-for-this-book"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;9&#8202;.&#8202;2</small> Why for this book?</a></h3>
<p>I could claim objects are groovy but out of scope for the book. Most programming language books, especially ones that try to implement a whole little language, leave objects out. To me, that means the topic isn&rsquo;t well covered. For such an widespread paradigm, that seems like an real omission.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to spend all day <em>using</em> an OOP language, shouldn&rsquo;t have at least an inkling of how it works under the hood? Implementing objects ourselves will definitely solve that. It gives us an excuse to implement hash tables and dynamic dispatch, and it turns out to be a lot of fun.</p>
<h3><a href="#classes-or-prototypes" name="classes-or-prototypes"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;9&#8202;.&#8202;3</small> Classes or prototypes?</a></h3>
<p>When it comes to objects, there are actually two styles, classes and prototypes. Classes are more common thanks to C++, Java, C#, and friends. Prototypes were a virtually forgotten offshoot until JavaScript accidentally took over the world.</p>
<p>The line between the two is a bit blurry once you look at the details of languages on both sides, but the basic idea is that in prototypes, you don&rsquo;t need to have some &ldquo;class&rdquo;-like construct that represents a &ldquo;kind of thing&rdquo;. Methods can exist right on an individual object and each object can be its own special snowflake.</p>
<p>With classes, there is always a level of indirection. When you call a method, you look up the object&rsquo;s class and then you find the method <em>there</em>. If it&rsquo;s not there, you walk the class&rsquo;s inheritance chain. With prototypes, method lookup is right on the object itself, then you walk its &ldquo;delegate&rdquo; or &ldquo;prototype&rdquo; chain.</p>
<p>This means prototypal languages are more &ldquo;fundamental&rdquo; in some way than classes. They are really fun to implement because they&rsquo;re so simple. Also, they can express lots of interesting patterns that built-in class support steers you away from.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve looked at a <em>lot</em> of code written in prototypal languages&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;including <a href="http://finch.stuffwithstuff.com/">some of my own devising</a>. Do you know what people generally do with all of the power and flexibility of prototypes? They use it to reinvent classes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know <em>why</em> that is, but people generally seem to like a class-based
(&ldquo;Classic&rdquo;? &ldquo;Classy&rdquo;?) style. Prototypes <em>are</em> simpler in the language, but it
seems to just <span name="waterbed">push</span> that complexity onto the user. So, for Lox, we&rsquo;ll cut out the middle man and go right to putting classes in the language.</p>
<aside name="waterbed">
<p>Larry Wall, Perl&rsquo;s inventor/prophet calls this the &ldquo;<a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?WaterbedTheory">waterbed
theory</a>&rdquo;. Some complexity is essential and cannot be eliminated. If you push
it down in one place it swells up in another.</p>
<p>Prototypal languages don&rsquo;t so much <em>eliminate</em> the complexity of classes as they
do make the <em>user</em> take that complexity by building their own class-like
metaprogramming libraries.</p>

<h3><a href="#classes-in-lox" name="classes-in-lox"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;9&#8202;.&#8202;4</small> Classes in Lox</a></h3>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s out of the way, let&rsquo;s see what Lox actually has. &ldquo;Classes&rdquo; describes a pretty large constellation of features in most languages. For Lox, I&rsquo;ve stripped it down to what I think are the essentials. You declare a class and its methods like so:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="vg">Breakfast</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">cook</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Eggs a-fryin&#39;!&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="n">serve</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">who</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Enjoy your breakfast, &quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">&quot; who.&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The body of a class contains a series of methods. Syntactically, they are identical to function declarations, but without the <code>fun</code> keyword. When the class declaration is executed, it produces a class object bound to its name. Just like functions, classes are first class in Lox:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// Store it in variables.</span>
<span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">someVariable</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="vg">Unicorn</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="c1">// Pass it to functions.</span>
<span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="vg">Breakfast</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now we need some way to create instances of this class. We could add some sort of <code>new</code> keyword, but to keep things simple, in Lox <em>the class itself is a factory function for instances</em>. Call it like a function and it produces a new instance of itself:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">breakfast</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="vg">Breakfast</span><span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div>


<h3><a href="#instantiation-and-initialization" name="instantiation-and-initialization"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;9&#8202;.&#8202;5</small> Instantiation and initialization</a></h3>
<p>Classes that just have behavior aren&rsquo;t very useful. The idea behind object-oriented programming is encapsulating behavior <em>and state</em> together. To do that, you need fields. Lox follows other dynamically typed languages in letting you add arbitrary state onto objects as you see fit:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">breakfast</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">meat</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;sausage&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">breakfast</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">bread</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;sourdough&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>.field</code> syntax can be used to access or assign fields. Assigning to a field creates it if it doesn&rsquo;t already exist. To access the current instance from a method on its class, you can use good old <code>this</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="vg">Breakfast</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">serve</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">who</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Enjoy your &quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nb">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">meat</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">&quot; and &quot;</span>
        <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nb">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">bread</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">&quot;, &quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">&quot; who.&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="c1">// ...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Typically, when you create an instance, you want the class to set up its state before anyone else sees it. To do that, you can define an initializer. If your class has a method named <code>init()</code>, it will be called when the object is constructed. Any parameters passed to the class are forwarded to it:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="vg">Breakfast</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">init</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">meat</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">bread</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nb">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">meat</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">bread</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="c1">// ...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">baconAndToast</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="vg">Breakfast</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;bacon&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;toast&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">baconAndToast</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">serve</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Dear Reader&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<h3><a href="#inheritance" name="inheritance"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;9&#8202;.&#8202;6</small> Inheritance</a></h3>
<p>Already, we&rsquo;ve increased the expressiveness of Lox quite a bit. We can define structures to aggregate bits of data together. We can associate behavior with them. Method calls are dynamically dispatched, so we&rsquo;ve got polymorphism too.</p>
<p>The next step is being able to reuse methods across classes. For that, Lox supports simple single inheritance. When you declare a class, you can specify a class that it inherits from using <span name="less"><code>&lt;</code></span>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="vg">Brunch</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="vg">Breakfast</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">drink</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;How about a Blood Mary?&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<aside name="less">
<p>Why <code>&lt;</code>? I didn&rsquo;t feel like introducing a new keyword like <code>extends</code>. Lox doesn&rsquo;t use <code>:</code> for anything else so I didn&rsquo;t want to reserve that either. Instead, I took a page from Ruby and used <code>&lt;</code>.</p>
<p>If you know any type theory, you&rsquo;ll notice it&rsquo;s not a <em>totally</em> arbitrary
choice. Every instance of a subclass is an instance of its superclass too, but
there may be instances of the superclass that are not instances of the subclass.
That means, in the universe of possible objects, the subclass has fewer than the
superclass. Its set of objects is &ldquo;smaller&rdquo;, though type nerds usually use <code>&lt;:</code>
for that relation.</p>
</aside>
<p>Here, Brunch is the <strong>derived class</strong> or <strong>subclass</strong>, and Breakfast is the <strong>base class</strong> or <strong>superclass</strong>. Any method defined in the superclass is also available to its subclasses:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">brunch</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="vg">Brunch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;ham&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;English muffin&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">brunch</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">serve</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Noble Reader&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Even the <code>init()</code> method gets inherited. In practice, the subclass usually wants to define its own <code>init()</code> method too. But the original one also needs to be called so that the superclass can maintain its own state. We need some way to call a method on our own instance without hitting our own methods.</p>
<p>As in Java and other languages, you use <code>super</code> for that:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="vg">Brunch</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="vg">Breakfast</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">init</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">meat</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">bread</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">drink</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">super</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">init</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">meat</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">bread</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="nb">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">drink</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">drink</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>From within a method, you can use <code>super.</code> followed by a name to call any method on the superclass, ignoring your own overriding ones.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about it. I tried to keep it minimal. The structure of the book did force one compromise. Lox is not a <em>pure</em> object-oriented language. In a true OOP language every object is an instance of a class, even primitive types like numbers and Booleans.</p>
<p>Because we don&rsquo;t implement classes until later in the book, that would have been hard. So values of primitive types aren&rsquo;t real objects in the sense of being instances of classes. They don&rsquo;t have methods or properties. If I were trying to make Lox a real language for real users, I would fix that.</p>
<h2><a href="#the-standard-library" name="the-standard-library"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;10</small> The Standard Library</a></h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re almost done. We&rsquo;ve covered all of the language and all that&rsquo;s left is the &ldquo;core&rdquo; or &ldquo;standard&rdquo; library&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;the set of functionality that is implemented directly in the interpreter and that all user-defined code is implemented in terms of. Your code library determines the set of what kinds of user programs are possible. If you don&rsquo;t provide functions to read files, users can&rsquo;t work around that on their own, unless you give them some sort of foreign function interface or other escape hatch.</p>
<p>This is the saddest part of Lox. It&rsquo;s standard library is beyond minimal. For the book, in order to be able to demonstrate that code is running and doing what it&rsquo;s supposed to do, all we need to support is printing text to the screen. Lox has <code>print()</code> for that.</p>
<p>Later, when we start worrying about optimization, we&rsquo;ll need to write some benchmarks and see how long it takes to execute code. So we need a way to track time. We&rsquo;ll also define a function <code>clock()</code> that returns the number of seconds since the application started.</p>
<p>And&hellip; that&rsquo;s it. I know, right? It&rsquo;s embarrassing.</p>
<p>If you wanted to turn Lox into an actual useful language, the very first thing you should do is flesh this out. String manipulation, trigonometric functions, file IO, networking, heck, even just <em>reading input from the user</em> would help. But we don&rsquo;t need any of that for this book, and adding it is mostly just grunt work, so I left it out.</p>

<h2><a href="#design-note" name="design-note">Design Note: Statements and Expressions
</a></h2>

<p>Lox&rsquo;s grammar is split into expressions and statements, but it&rsquo;s not a foregone
conclusion that you <em>need</em> statements. Some languages treat declarations
and control flow constructs as expressions. These &ldquo;everything is an expression&rdquo;
languages tend to have functional pedigrees and include most Lisps, SML,
Haskell, Ruby, and CoffeeScript.</p>
<p>That means, for each &ldquo;statement-like&rdquo; construct in the language, you need to decide what value it evaluates to. Some of those are easy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An <code>if</code> expression evaluates to the result of whichever branch is chosen. Likewise, a <code>switch</code> or other multi-way branch evaluates to whichever case is picked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A variable declaration evaluates to the value of the variable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A block or sequence of expressions evaluates to the result of the last expression in the sequence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some get a little stranger. What should a loop evaluate to? A <code>while</code> loop in
CoffeeScript evaluates to an array containing each element that the body
evaluated to. That can be handy, or a waste of effort if you don&rsquo;t need the
array.</p>
<p>You also have to decide how these statement-like expressions compose with other
expressions&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;you have to fit them into the precedence table. For example, Ruby
allows:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="kp">true</span> <span class="k">then</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="k">end</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Is this what you&rsquo;d expect? Is it what your users want? How does this affect how you design the syntax for your statements? Note that here Ruby has an explicit <code>end</code> to tell when the <code>if</code> expression is complete. Without it, the <code>+ 4</code> would likely be parsed as part of the <code>else</code> clause.</p>
<p>Turning every statement into an expression forces you to answer a few hairy questions like that. In return, you can usually remove some redundancy from the language. C has both blocks for sequencing statements, and the comma operator for sequencing expression. It has both the <code>if</code> statement and the <code>?:</code> conditional operator to accomplish the same thing in either an expression or statement context. If everything was an expression in C, it would eliminate that redundancy.</p>
<p>Languages that do away with statements usually also feature <strong>implicit returns</strong>&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;a function automatically returns whatever value its body evaluates to without need for some explicit <code>return</code> syntax. For small functions and methods, this is really handy. In fact, many languages that do have statements have added syntax like <code>=&gt;</code> to be able to define functions whose body is the result of evaluating a single expression.</p>
<p>But making <em>all</em> functions work that way can be a little strange. If you aren&rsquo;t careful, your function will leak a return value even if you only intend it to produce a side effect. In practice, though, users of these languages don&rsquo;t find it to be a problem.</p>
<p>For Lox, I gave it statements for prosaic reasons. I gave it a C-like syntax for familiarity&rsquo;s sake, and trying to take the existing C syntax for statements and interpret them like expressions gets weird pretty fast.</p>
