**TODO: when can we introduce a print statement/function?**

needs to happen before statements and flow control otherwise those aren't
visible to user.

        - why learn languages?
            - in full programming career, will end up doing something related to
              language
            - good way to learn lots of techniques: recursion, trees, graphs,
              state machines, memory management, optimization
            - hard, training with weights on
            - fun

        - languages used in impl
        - what's in book
        - what's not in book
        - end goal is high quality, efficient interpreter suitable for real use
        - to get there, narrow path through space, not broad survey
        - will point to alternatives to explore on own
        - learn enough to carry conversation with professional lang person

principles

- each top-level section builds one interpreter starting from scratch
- since the book will be "published" online serially, the chapters should be
  ordered such that they are useful even while the book is incomplete. that
  probably means doing all of parsing for the whole grammar isn't a good idea:
  it's boring until later chapters do something with it.

- kinds of content in a chapter
  - main narrative with prose and code
  - historical context and people
  - further things to learn
  - omitted alternatives
  - review questions: ask things chapter did explain
  - challenges: add new features or compare other languages
  - quotation at beginning of each chapter
  - engineering considerations: error handling, maintainability, etc.
  - design and pyschology: usability, aesthetics, popularity, learnability, etc.

stuff to maybe include:

- error-handling
    - stack traces and line information
    - runtime errors
- variables
    - scopes as dictionaries
    - name binding of locals
    - variables and assignment
    - scope
- object model
    - objects as dictionaries
    - objects
    - classes
    - prototypes
    - nan tagging
    - object representation
    - symbol tables and hash tables
    - strings
    - arrays
    - hash tables (for internal use and as object in language)
    - dynamic dispatch
- syntax
    - aesthetics and usability of syntax design
    - backjumping and infinite lookahead or context-sensitive grammars
