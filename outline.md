        - who book is for
        - who am i

        - why learn languages?
            - in full programming career, will end up doing something related to
              language
            - good way to learn lots of techniques: recursion, trees, graphs,
              state machines, memory management, optimization
            - hard, training with weights on
            - fun
            - dispell magic
        - structure of book
        - languages used in impl
        - what's in book
        - what's not in book
        - end goal is high quality, efficient interpreter suitable for real use
        - to get there, narrow path through space, not broad survey
        - will point to alternatives to explore on own
        - learn enough to carry conversation with professional lang person

principles
- each top-level section builds one interpreter starting from scratch
- since the book will be "published" online serially, the chapters should be
  ordered such that they are useful even while the book is incomplete. that
  probably means doing all of parsing for the whole grammar isn't a good idea:
  it's boring until later chapters do something with it.


stuff to maybe include:

- gc
    - mark-sweep collection
